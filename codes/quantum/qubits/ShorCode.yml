introduced: 'Shor''s code is the first known quantum error correction code. \cite{doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493}'

# Anything applicable to a larger parent set of codes (see below) should go in
# that entry instead of here.
description: 'Shor''s code, also known as the [[9,1,3]] code, is an instance of degenerate \hyperref[code:stabilizer]{stabillizer code}. Shor'' code is also an exmaple of planar code \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9810055}.'



realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.
  - 'Realized in trapped-ion quantum devices, with 98.8(1)\% and 98.5(1)\% fidelity for state \(|\pm \rangle_L\), respectively.  \cite{arXiv:2104.01205}'
